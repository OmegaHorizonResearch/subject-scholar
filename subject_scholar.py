# Subject Scholar is a class for finding hierarchical subject matter motifs in natural language. Finds common word roots and suffixes, thematic phrases, and specialized subject discourses.

# Implementation: use CNN's and a custom information criterion to perform non-specific supervised learning. A model for extracting topics at various levels of linguistic hierarchy is selected and used to analyse bodies of text to determine their topical content. Model selection is a key process of the training phase, as not only do multiple models need to be trained, but compared on the basis of their statistical merits.
